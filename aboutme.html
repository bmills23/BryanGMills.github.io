    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I attended the University of Pittsburgh's main campus from 2013 to 2017
        to pursue a Bachelor's of Science in Geology.  Additionally, I pursued Latin and Ancient Greek language studies 
        and received a minor in Classics.  My college education taught me to adapt 
        to new ideas and embrace them head-on with indefatigable determination. 
    </p>
    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>My post-college career has been in production for about four and a half years now.
        My greatest desire in my career is to carve out a sustainable niche in a challenging and 
        satistfying position.</p>
    <p>My first job out of college at ECS Limited in Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania involved determining the geotechnical properties of prospective construction sites
        as well as verifying specification conformance of construction materials.  In the office, I constructed reports, assessed geographical information
        system data and databases, performed site history research, and performed multivariable data entry and organization.  
    </p>
    <p>
        After deciding to set sail for Denver, Colorado, I pursued a field work position with Kumar and Associates.  There, I verified the specification conformance of
        various construction materials, including steel, masonry, concrete, soil, and asphalt.  It was a very intense and detailed-oriented job where acquisition of accurate data and measurements was tantamount 
        to the success of a projects whose budgets often exceeded millions of dollars. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My current position at Palmetto Environmental Group is highly variable and extremely detail-oriented.  In the field, I work alone or with my peers to collect soil and groundwater data.  I am also trusted to manage subcontractors to acquire soil and groundwater data and to install
        groundwater monitoring wells.  I am constantly trusted to make judgement calls without consultation of my peers due to my knowledge and experience.
        In the office, I do a multitude of different things: computer assisted 
        design modeling, mathematical calculations,  
        data analysis, and detailed report construction.  
    </p> 
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Let's just say I've got a lot of hobbies!  Rock-climbing, hiking, biking, running, sourdough, painting, and occassionally knife-making just to name a few.
          I'm always willing to try new things and am constantly looking to challenge myself mentally and physically.  In my free time, I also enjoy coding and learning
        how to code because it adds extra challenge to my life.
